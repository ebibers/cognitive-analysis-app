# Cognitive skills analysis tool
The cognitive skills analysis tool is a python programm that includes three tests which evaluate your cognitive skills.
The three tests are: reaction test, memory test, coordination test. The results of these tests are saved in a separate
excel file that is created upon first execution. The programm also has an analysis tab which allows the user to generate
a graph and shows statistics that summarize all the scores.

## Requirements
- matplotlib 3.8.2
- openpyxl 3.1.2
- pandas 2.1.4
